## Key Skills & Attributes 

- Experienced Communicator - Articulate and to the point, I break down problems and can explain them in plain English. Pair programming has been a central part of my software development course, providing daily opportunities to explain my code and how I have tackled problems - as well as listening to feedback and implementing improvements. I have worked in numerous customer facing roles, providing me with experience listening to client needs and and proactively solving their problems. 

- Team Spirit - I thrive in a team environment, comfortable collaborating and always open to new ideas. When working in a team I am supportive of other members and strive to ensure every person is heard. I also speak up if something isnâ€™t working correctly and make sure the whole team is working together towards the same mutual goal. During the Makers course, I encouraged discussion and open communication after a fallout between two team members. I encouraged the wider team to voice their opinion in an open evnironment and facilitate my peers in working on parts of the project that interested them.

- Personal Drive & Growth - I am consistently working towards improving my skillset outside of Makers. I am currently working with a mentor to build a marketplace website where I am improving my TDD and changeability of code. I am also working towards becoming an AWS Cloud Practitioner. This growth mindset is very important as technologies and langauges are continually involving, and I want to be at the forefront of this. 

- Problem Solver - At my previous role as a sales executive we were suffering from a low click through rate on Google Adverts. In order to solve this problem, our website needed SEO improvements and new Google Ads. I took action by downloading SEO improvement tools and making content changes to help the organisations' website ranking. Furthermore, I refreshed the Google Ad text in relation to the website changes so that both adverts and website displayed a cohesive message. The result of this was a doubling of sales month-on-month from January through to March. 

## Education

#### Makers Academy April - July 2021)
Intensive 4-month software development course focusing on how to 'learn to learn' coding. Predominantly based in Ruby with other opportunities to learn JavaScript, React and Rails. The course has given me the confidence to learn any coding language and provided a clear process in order to deliver clean DRY code. 

#### University of Exeter (Sept 2017 - July 2020)
Liberal Arts BA - Major in History. 


### Problem Solving Case Study 

At my previous role as a sales executive we were suffering from a low click through rate on Google Adverts. In order to solve this problem, our website needed SEO improvements and the wording of the Google Ads needed refreshing. I took action by downloading SEO improvement tools and making content changes to help the organisations website ranking. Furthermore, I refreshed the Google Ad text in relation to the website changes so that both adverts and website displayed a cohesive message. The result of this was a doubling of sales month-on-month from January through to March.
