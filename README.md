### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Felix Piercy
A driven Makers Academy graduate with a positive learning mindset, ready to thrive as a developer. I continue to further my skillset beyond Makers Academy by working towards the Amazon Web Services Cloud Practitioner qualification and personal projects. My key language strength is in Ruby as well as building knowledge of JavaScript. Keen interest in serverless software deployment and following a test driven development process.

## Favourite Coding Projects

Betwixt - My final project completed with 5 other talented Makers. Betwixt finds the mid-point between you and your friend, then recommending a variety of restaurants/bars/cafes for you to meet. The project uses Next.js and involved the integration of numerous APIs. 

MakersBNB - a website where users can create a space to rent, and guests can request to book. This project was the most formative experience for me during the course as it involved conflict, building on existing concepts and beginning to style our applications. 

Notes Application - a JavaScript web app allowing the user to record notes, which are listed in an abbreviated form which can then be expanded. This project is significant to me because it exemplified fantastic teamwork. Working with 2 peers, we approached the project in a cohesive manner and were all very supportive of one another. We took time for self-learning and had a high-test coverage despite only spending 2 weeks on JS at this stage.

## Key Skills & Attributes 

- Experienced Communicator - Articulate and to the point, I break down problems and can explain them in plain English. Pair programming has been a central part of my software development course, providing daily opportunities to explain my code and how I have tackled problems - as well as listening to feedback and implementing improvements. I have worked in numerous customer facing roles, providing me with experience listening to client needs and and proactively solving their problems. 

- Team Spirit - I thrive in a team environment, comfortable collaborating and always open to new ideas. When working in a team I am supportive of other members and strive to ensure every person is heard. I also speak up if something isnâ€™t working correctly and make sure the whole team is working together towards the same mutual goal. During the Makers course, I encouraged discussion and open communication after a fallout between two team members. I encouraged the wider team to voice their opinion in an open evnironment and facilitate my peers in working on parts of the project that interested them.

- Personal Drive & Growth - I am consistently working towards improving my skillset outside of Makers. I am currently working with a mentor to build a marketplace website where I am improving my TDD and changeability of code. I am also working towards becoming an AWS Cloud Practitioner. This growth mindset is very important as technologies and langauges are continually involving, and I want to be at the forefront of this. 

- Problem Solver - At my previous role as a sales executive we were suffering from a low click through rate on Google Adverts. In order to solve this problem, our website needed SEO improvements and new Google Ads. I took action by downloading SEO improvement tools and making content changes to help the organisations' website ranking. Furthermore, I refreshed the Google Ad text in relation to the website changes so that both adverts and website displayed a cohesive message. The result of this was a doubling of sales month-on-month from January through to March. 

## Education

#### Makers Academy April - July 2021)
Intensive 4-month software development course focusing on how to 'learn to learn' coding. Predominantly based in Ruby with other opportunities to learn JavaScript, React and Rails. The course has given me the confidence to learn any coding language and provided a clear process in order to deliver clean DRY code. 

#### University of Exeter (Sept 2017 - July 2020)
Liberal Arts BA - Major in History. 


### Problem Solving Case Study 

At my previous role as a sales executive we were suffering from a low click through rate on Google Adverts. In order to solve this problem, our website needed SEO improvements and the wording of the Google Ads needed refreshing. I took action by downloading SEO improvement tools and making content changes to help the organisations website ranking. Furthermore, I refreshed the Google Ad text in relation to the website changes so that both adverts and website displayed a cohesive message. The result of this was a doubling of sales month-on-month from January through to March.
